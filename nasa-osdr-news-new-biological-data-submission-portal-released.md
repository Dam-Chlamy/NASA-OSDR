The Open Science Data Repositories introduce a multi-project web-based submission portal to support self-service metadata curation and data submission within FAIR Guidelines. To increase reusability and access of biological data the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and GeneLab integrated to develop the Biological Data Management Environment (BDME). A system that allows researchers to submit spaceflight and space relevant omics, phenomics, physiological, and behavioral data. The integration of GeneLab and ALSDA will directly contribute to building a stronger and more cohesive spaceflight open science [data repository](broken-reference) to include space life sciences experimental data.

The release of the multi-project submission portal built upon GeneLabâ€™s existing infrastructure to expand the utility and scope of the system. Standards such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and the ISA framework continue to be key features across the BDME. Adopting the ISA framework, a standard for organizing and managing life sciences and biomedical experimental data, researchers will be guided submission to deposit biological data according to established metadata and data standards. BDME also introduces a [collaborative workspace](broken-reference) to share, organize, and store files throughout the course of your experiment.

A new function added to the BDME, includes an online tool to guide NASA funded researchers through their Research Data Submission Agreement (RDSA) to improve data submission planning. The RDSA form guides NASA investigators through the process of defining data products, assays, and/or tissues for submission to a NASA data repository. The RDSA helps guide investigators; Space Biology and Human Research Program solicitation awardees, PI Self-Forming BSP Team Collaborators and NBISC biospecimen and material requestors with submission of their data to NASA and helps investigators meet the obligations of their Space NASA grants.

The overarching goal was to develop a portal to reduce the burden on PIs submitting data and enable discovery of both omics and phenomics data while building upon the FAIR principles. This is the first major release of BDME, with usability and improvement releases still to come.
